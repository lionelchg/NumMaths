# 2D amplification factors

Notes concerning the derivation of 2D amplification factors. We assume equal spacing $\Delta x$ in $x$ and $y$ direction and we solve

$$
u_t + \vb{a} \cdot \nabla u = 0
$$

with

$$
\vb{a} = a (\cos(\alpha) \vb{e}_x + \sin(\alpha) \vb{e}_y)
$$

Starting from a mode $k$ solution

$$
u(\vb{x}, t) = \hat{V}(k) e^{\I(\vb{k} \cdot \vb{x} - \omega t)}
$$

The exact amplification factor is
