# NumMaths

Study of numerical mathematics with a repository for numerical schemes and another one for numerical systems (linear and non-linear)

## NumSchemes

`NumSchemes` is a repository to study numerical schemes.

`PDE/1D/` focuses on one dimensional schemes of advection related problems
with schemes detailed in Chapters 7 and 8 of *Numerical Computation of Internal and External Flows: The Fundamentals of Computational Fluid Dynamics*, Charles Hirsch (Elsevier, second edition, 2007)

`ODE/` is an implementation of examples presented in Karen Willcox, and Qiqi Wang. 16.90 *Computational Methods in Aerospace Engineering*. Spring 2014. Massachusetts Institute of Technology: MIT OpenCourseWare, https://ocw.mit.edu. License: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA.

## NumSystems

`NumSystems` contains for now study of simple Poisson problem matrices.
